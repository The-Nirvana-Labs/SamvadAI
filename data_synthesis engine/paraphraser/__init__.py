    Paraphrasing is a technique that involves rephrasing a piece of text in a way that conveys the same meaning but
    uses different words and phrasing. This can be useful for generating more diverse data from an existing dataset,
    and can also be used to simplify or clarify complex language. Paraphrasing can be done manually or using automated
    tools such as language models or machine learning algorithms.
