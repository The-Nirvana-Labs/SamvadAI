    Textual entailment is a technique that involves determining whether one piece of text logically implies another.
    This can be useful for generating new data that is consistent with existing data, or for verifying the accuracy of
    generated data. Textual entailment can be done using various natural language processing techniques, such as semantic
    role labeling, dependency parsing, and machine learning algorithms.
