"""
    Sentence fusion involves combining two or more sentences into a single sentence while preserving the original
    meaning. This technique can be used to create more complex sentences from simpler ones, or to generate new sentences
    that contain information from multiple source sentences. Sentence fusion can be done manually or using automated
    tools such as natural language processing algorithms.
