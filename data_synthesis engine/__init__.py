    Neural style transfer is a technique that involves transferring the style of one piece of text to another. This
    can be useful for generating new data that has a different tone or writing style than the original data. Neural style
    transfer can be done using various machine learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent
    neural networks, and can be applied to various types of text data, such as poetry, prose, or dialogue.
