    Text generation with GPT-2 involves using a pre-trained neural network to generate new text based on a given
    prompt or seed text. GPT-2 is a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI that can generate high-quality
    text in a variety of styles and genres. This technique can be used to generate new data that is similar to existing
    data, or to generate entirely new data based on a given theme or topic.
