    Text summarization is a technique that involves generating a concise and meaningful summary of a longer piece of
    text. This can be done using various algorithms, such as extraction-based or abstraction-based methods, and can be
    used to condense a large amount of information into a more manageable form. The goal of text summarization is to
    preserve the most important information while discarding irrelevant details.
